# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location quality. We use a linear regression model to build the predictive model. The dataset is generated synthetically using Python.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `generate_house_prices.py`: Script to generate a synthetic dataset of house prices.
- `house_prices.csv`: The generated dataset containing house features and prices.
- `house_price_prediction.py`: Main script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build the linear regression model, and evaluate it.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
